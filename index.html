					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p><img class="profile" src="assets/images/me.jpg" height="200" width="200">I'm an award-winning multimedia journalist with more than 12 years of experience writing news and features for print, web, TV and radio. I've formerly worked as a radio news reporter and producer for Public News Service. My work has been broadcast daily - sometimes by more than 100 radio stations - and was typically heard by more than a million listeners across four Midwestern states. <br><br>

					I've also worked as a news writer and voice over talent for TouchVisionTV's nationally syndicated one-hour daily news and entertainment program. My proudest moments, however, include a five-year run as a field reporter and in-studio producer for WGN Radio News where my coverage included politics, labor issues and other on-the-scene happenings in Chicago.</p>
